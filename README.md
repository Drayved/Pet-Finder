# Pet Finder

Pet Finder is a web application that pulls pet information from the Pet Finder API. Created with a lot of love for pets, this project aims to provide users with an easy and convenient way to search for adoptable pets. It utilizes React, HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

## Key Features

- **Search Pets**: Pet Finder allows users to search for adoptable pets by various criteria such as breed, age, name, and type of pet. Users can also search for pets near their location by providing their location or using a specific ZIP code.

- **Multiple Pet Types**: The application supports multiple types of pets, including dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, birds, and more. Users can easily switch between pet types and explore the available options for each type.

- **Pet Information**: Pet Finder displays comprehensive pet information, including multiple pictures, description, breed, age, and other details. Users can get a complete overview of the pet's characteristics and determine if it's a good match for their preferences.

- **Adoption Links**: For users interested in adopting a pet, Pet Finder provides links to the official Pet Finder website where they can find more information and initiate the adoption process. This seamless integration ensures a smooth transition from the application to the adoption platform.

- **Backend Server**: Pet Finder includes a backend server hosted on Vercel. The server was built using Express.js and serves as an intermediary between the frontend application and the Pet Finder API. Please note that upon the initial load of the site, it may take some time for the backend server to pull the information. Kindly be patient during this process.

- **API Limitations**: Please note that the Pet Finder API has limitations on the number of requests that can be made in a single day. The project was designed to work around this limitation and provide a reliable user experience. However, in case of any issues related to API requests, it is recommended to try again later.
